This all text should be unassigned
Until we come accross an instruction
That then shall be verse if not found

[Chorus]
We begin with a chorus
Cuz we can

[Bridge]
Then a bridge
Cuz, again, we can

This should not be relevant anymore
And should not even be counted
Because we do not track anything after the ruler
For performance reasons
