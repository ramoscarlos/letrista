This is going to be ignored
As well as this second line

[Title]



A-This was the title but not now
Here we will begin our title
--And this should be ignored
As well as this one



Since only the topmost is the title

[Intro]
Here is an intro section
A I wonder how it will display
--I wonder how it will display
A-I wonder how it will display
--But, men, so many comments

[Verse]
Line 1


A 00 This has the syllable count
A And this one does not


X __ This will be our fourth line
A-This is commented

[Prechorus]
This is before the chorus, right?
It has to, right?
I mean, it says 'Pre', duh

[Chorus]



This will be repeated
I have nothing else to say
I does not even rhyme
But I'm just the systems guy

[Postchorus]
And, of course, this is after
--With comments


And lots of


Empty lines

A-Just to see what this does



A __ Is this even a valid example?

Random words, put together

[Bridge]
Change of pace
Feels good, huh?

[Verse]
Another verse


Another time
I am getting tired of these examples

[Outro]
And here is the end

This is way too much chaos

Isn't it?









***********

This gets ignored by
virtue of the five start above.

-- Regardles of the type of line
A __ That one can put in here
X This will still be ignored

So many lines
