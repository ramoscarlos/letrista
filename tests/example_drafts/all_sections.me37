Here we will begin our title
============================

_**Here is an intro section
I wonder how it will display**_

Line 1
This has the syllable count
And this one does not
This will be our fourth line

##This is before the chorus, right?
It has to, right?
mean, it says 'Pre', duh##

**This will be repeated
have nothing else to say
does not even rhyme
But I'm just the systems guy**

$$And, of course, this is after
And lots of
Empty lines
Is this even a valid example?
Random words, put together$$

_Change of pace
Feels good, huh?_

Another verse
Another time
am getting tired of these examples

**_And here is the end
This is way too much chaos
Isn't it?_**
